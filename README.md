Icom uses resistive buttons to control the Voice, Morse, and RTTY keyer.  This includes radios like the IC-7300, IC-7610, and IC-705.

The IC-7300 only has the ability to repond to 4 buttons through the mic jack.

Button boards are available for radios that support 8 buttons.

This project uses an arduino with some diodes and resistors to read a voltage divider based on the resistance of the buttons.  This is then converted into CI-V commands to control the radio.
